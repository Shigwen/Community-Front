			Community Project was, before it was an app, a concept : I soon realised that in classic, the social aspect was very important,
			and I ended up having a lot of friends in many different guilds. I couldn't play much with them though, since when you're managing
			a guild and mainly focusing on raiding, you won't get to spend much time with them if you have a busy real life.
			<br><br>
			When you don't share a guild chat, when you can only whisper to people in order to ask some news but you can barely share some time
			with them, it's hard to keep in touch. You end up mainly raiding, not necessarely only with people you like, and it soon becomes a chore.
			<br><br>
			You have to prepare to get DM buffs, sometimes more than two hours before the raid. Then wait. Walk around the world / take portals
			/ ask for summons. In the end you spend more time getting buffs supposed to speed up the raid than they actually speed up the raid.
			<br><br>
			Things can quickly become dull when you're not surrounded by the right people. But you want to stay with your guild anyway because
			they invested in you. You don't want to betray their trust and expectations, but you're not really having fun.
			<br><br>
			If some or all of this sounds a bit too familiar, you're in the right place.
			<br><br>
			When I first started to imagine how I could solve those problems, I started thinking about this app. Let me tell you how useful it's going to be.
			<br><br>
			When we will all attack TBC, not every community out there will have 10 people ready to tackle Karazhan at the same time.
			Sometimes you will have only 8, and you will need 2 more. Sometimes you will have 12, and those 2 extra people will need a raid outside their community.
			Even when you'll have 20 raiders in your roster, you'll need 5 extra to start 25-men raids. Then you'll need to find raids for your alts. And so on.
			<br><br>
			This is what this project is all about. Helping you organise, manage or just find raids at all times with people you like,
			outside or inside your guild. The more guilds participate, the better. If we could have one centralised hub for most pugs on the server,
			this project will quickly thrive.
			<br><br>
			Depending on how it goes, I'll add more functionalities to the app over time. Let's all have fun together in World of Warcraft !
			<br><br>
			For now, it's restricted to Hydraxian Waterlords (then the TBC version).
